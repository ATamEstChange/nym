# Network Requesters

> The network requester setup and maintenance guide has moved to the [Operator Guides book](TO_DO).

Network requesters are the first instance of the catch-all term 'service', or 'service providers'. In essence, think of services as being the part of the mixnet infrastructure that let you _do_ something, such as access emails, messaging service backends, or blockchains via the mixnet. 

Network requesters, in essence, act as a form of proxy (somewhat analagous to a Tor exit node)
